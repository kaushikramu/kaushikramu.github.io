Becoming Public {#becoming-public .entry-title}
===============

<div class="entry-content">

**Updated January 2015**

This is a draft. It’s not ready.

If anyone is reading this, it’s because I’ve succeeded, at least a
little bit, in developing a public version of myself. It is something I
have struggled with, a bit, and so I am going to begin by describing
what I’ve learned by developing this public version of me.

First, why am I creating a web presence for myself (after all these
happy years without one)?

I have been a librarian for about as long as I have been an adult.
 However, nothing about working in libraries required me to have a
consistent, public, web self. That has changed as I have gotten involved
in digital scholarship over the past few years.  I won’t define DH or
DS, but I will say that within the DH and digital scholarship
communities, there is an expectation that expertise will be shared in
new ways. In creative ways. So, **if I’m advocating for projects that
are brave and public, I want to be brave and public as well.** Here
goes.

Second, practically speaking, how am I going to do this

-   ~~Find or take a mildly professional photograph of myself that is
    actually me.~~  (thanks, Haverford!)  Of course, there’s absolutely
    nothing wrong with having a public persona that doesn’t include a
    picture! nothing at all. I can see all sorts of reasons for
    doing that. But, I wanted a picture.
-   ~~Buy my domain name~~. I went with bluehost, and since
    [laurieallen.net](http://laurieallen.net/) (yay!!)  and
    laurieallen.com were taken, I have laurieallen.org. I’m not an
    organization, but I’m also not a company or a network, so whatever.
-   ~~Update my~~
    [resume](../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LauraAllenResume20150125.pdf).
    Updating my resume meant deciding which kind of dabbling I want to
    claim as official skills, and which things I want to ignore. It also
    meant deciding what parts of the library-work I’ve done over the
    last 12 years should count, and which of my projects and passions
    and responsibilities I need to let go of. That was sad and hard.
    ~~(so sad and hard that it’s not done yet)~~
-   Decide exactly what kinds of things should go on this page. Is it a
    blog? ~~Should I use WordPress?~~ (yes. i’m using wordpress)
-   Find a web design that I liked. I’m not crazy about the current
    style, but I suspect I’ll keep dabbling forever.
-   ~~Start keeping track of what I’m reading in a formal and organized
    way~~. (pocket is great!) It turns out that, as a librarian, I just
    read and learn and absorb and get curious, and follow things,
    without ever keeping track of where particular versions of my ideas
    come from. Because, basically, as long as I’m not putting anything
    in writing, it’s not really unacceptable to say “I think Bethany
    Nowviskie talks about this in interesting ways” or “Ta-Nehisi Coates
    has totally helped me think about the connections between curiosity
    and librarians” without having to actually point to a place. But, if
    I’m going to make public statements in recorded places, I need to
    have a better sense of the genealogy of my perspectives on
    various topics.
-   Start writing some blog posts…
    -   perhaps one on not identifying as an alt-ac, and on the curious
        way that feels in the current world
    -   start posting my experiments with leaflet and the various
        mapmaking experiments I’ve got going.
    -   one on the difficulty of finding good soup to nuts anatomies of
        technology of the sort that I think all citizens should have
        access to.
    -   and of course, maybe one on the universe of things that would be
        my research interests if i had research interest (cities, maps,
        mental maps, physical maps, digital maps, power and borders in
        the US)
    -   something about the wonders I saw in the libraries I visited in
        Mexico
