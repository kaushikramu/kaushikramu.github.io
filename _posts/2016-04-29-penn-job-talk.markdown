### Penn Libraries Job Talk

What follows is a very lightly edited version of the talk I gave as part of my interview for the job of Assistant Director for Digital Scholarship on December 4, 2015. I had a lot of slides, and most of them aren't here (there are links where there were screenshots, instead). Also, I had a bunch of jokes in the talk. It turns out I'm very corny. I couldn't keep them in the written version either.

## The prompt:

> **Discuss three ways in which the nature of academic scholarship is changing and identify key services for each that Penn Libraries should offer in support of researchers’ evolving needs.**


Thank you so much for being here today. My talk today is going to address the question I was asked, but before I get started, I will spend a few moments talking about who I am and what I’m bringing to this question. Part of what I bring is my love for Philly. This is my home, and the city I love. As many of you know I worked here at Penn from 2002-2008, and I've been at Haverford for the past 7 and a half years. For the first few years at Haverford, I was the Coordinator for Research, Instruction, and Outreach.  After we brought in an awesome new library director and she led us through a big re-organization, I moved into my current role as Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Services.

In that role, I’ve been working with my colleagues to build a Digital Scholarship program. At Haverford, we define digital scholarship as library partnerships with faculty and students to create scholarship in new forms. Building this program means we’ve built the human and technical infrastructure in the library to make digital scholarship as manageable and sustainable as we think it can reasonably be, understanding that learning and creating scholarship is a creative, messy, and iterative process. In practical terms, our work involves engagements with faculty and students in the curriculum, on larger scale research projects, and fellowships, internships and jobs for students. Over the past few years, the digital scholarship group has been involved in dozens of courses, ranging from 20 minute drop-ins to courses where DS labs were built into the weekly schedule and integral to the course outline. We’re now in our second year running a fellowship program for students interested in a sustained DS learning opportunity, and we recently hired a drexel libary school intern to help run that program. We’re also partnering with faculty on some big and exciting projects, some of which I’ll mention in this talk, and others of which I won’t but would be happy to talk about later.

The team in Digital Scholarship at Haverford includes me and my colleague Mike fulltime, and then two people who don’t report to me but who work closely with us, a metadata specialist and our web coordinator (and Music Librarian). As part of the library, our group works really closely with our colleagues in special collections and with the subject librarians on nearly all of our projects. And truly, when describing the team, the key to our success is the 12 student workers we employ. Or, it’s 12 this semester, and an overlapping 12 over the summer. Our students tend to stay with us throughout their college career, some of them joining us in summers, and they develop considerable expertise in the tools, approaches and strategies we employ in our work.

So, that's the work I've been doing, and I'll return to aspects of it during the rest of this talk.

Now to the question.
In inviting me for this interview, I was asked to:

> **Discuss three ways in which the nature of academic scholarship is changing and identify key services for each that Penn Libraries should offer in support of researchers’ evolving needs.**


When we think about developing new services, I think the most important lesson I’ve learned at Haverford is that the nature of our library is co-created by faculty, librarians, and students, as well as by administrators. So I think the best way to build library programs is by instituting strong processes to engage in that co-creation, and to accept that things will keep changing. This means building from where you are, moving through stages, and being flexible in working with collaborators. With that in mind, I’m going to talk about changes in the following areas.

1. Data is everywhere
1. Multimodal scholarship
1. Interdisciplinary and community engaged scholarship

Truly, these three changes are all closely connected to one another and so some of the recommendations I'll make will overlap across these three areas. But, I think these shifts in scholarship are different enough to imply a few distinct activities within libraries. So on to the first:

## Data is everywhere
What do I mean by data?
Data means a lot of things, and it’s been around for a long time before there were computers. But these days, data, broadly, ends up meaning stuff that can be processed by computers. And the range of things that can be processed by computers keeps growing. People have access to more and simpler computational power, and we’re learning lots of new ways to understand things when we approach them with computers.

When I say that data is everywhere, I mean that more and more of our objects of study are machine-readable. So, works of literature can be considered data when they’re processed through topic modeling. Computers can operate on temporal data, and on geospatial data, that is, they can help us understand things in terms of time and space at various scales. Films and objects in space can be modeled with computers to create data that we can learn from in new ways. I don't want to imply that this data is all raw or without meaning, or that it is not part of other systems and structures. But this data explosion in the academy certainly is happening, and it is worth contending with.

What does this rise in data imply about library activities? What should libraries do about this plethora of data, and the creep of data thinking throughout the academy? Here are a few things. First:

# Libraries should: Approach library collections as data
So, in terms of ways we can respond to the rise of data in libraries, there are a few. Starting with the notion of library collections as data.

This can mean a lot of things.
First, it means we understand that there will be researchers who use our collections not just to learn from each item one at a time but who seek to find out what they can learn if they look across whole collections at once. Understanding this, when we buy or lease materials to add to our collections, we need to ensure that our community also has the rights to use the material as data.

Beyond our licensing an purchasing agreements, libraries should make it easy for people to engage with our collections as data. I love [OPenn](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/). It’s an awesome way to provide access to the amazing collection of digitized images of collection materials, and using OPenn allows researchers who want to address those images and their metadata in bulk to re-use them and re-imagine them in exciting ways.

There are other libraries who provide access to digital collections as data. Here I'll call out the [DocSouthData project at UNC](http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/), [Indiana University Libraries' Digital Collections on Github](https://github.com/iulibdcs), and the recently released [open collections api from UBC](https://open.library.ubc.ca/research) as three awesome examples. I'd actually love to spend a lot more time talking about these three different models, and the pros and cons of each, but I'll keep going for now as there is a lot more to discuss.

It's also important to point out that joining [Hathi Trust](https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc) and [DPLA](http://dp.la/info/developers/download/), both of which provide bulk or api access to data or metadata, is another important step in approaching library collections as data.

# Libraries should: Expose library metadata as data
The mention of Hathi Trust and DPLA brings me a little deeper into the world of exposing library collections as data, and that's just a little side trip to talk about making sure that we [expose the metadata](http://catalogdata.library.illinois.edu/) about [library collections](http://library.harvard.edu/open-metadata) as data. We can learn a lot from our metadata, and opening it up for analysis using a whole host of tools and methods is really exciting to me. Our metadata provides a record of what we have valued over the years of our libraries. It can help us understand our own histories, what is present and what is absent in our collections, as well as how we've been describing the scholarship we provide access to. And once we've gotten into exposing our collections and metadata as data, it takes me to my next point, which is that...

# Libraries should: Study our own collections as data
I mean this not just as a way of developing services or collections, though that's important. But as a way of engaging in scholarship that reflects on our own institutions, on what it means to make these collections, and what it means to make them digitally available. There are some really [good](http://spatialinformationdesignlab.org/project_sites/library/catalog.html) [examples](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/projects) of schools who are doing this. At Haverford, we've been thinking a lot about what we can learn from our collections when we use them as data. We've also been talking a lot about about what it means to make a collection meaningfully digital. I want to pause here to talk about one project we worked on last summer, and which will continue for the next few summers, where we wanted student to learn from a collection, and produce digital information, but we weren't sure that creating images of the collection was going to be the most valuable way to do that.
The Haverford Libraries recently received records from the Friends Hospital, one of the earliest Mental Health Institutions in the US, opened in 1819.

![Quakers and Mental Health homepage](/assets/images/qmh-webpage.jpg)

With support from the Scattergood Foundation, we decided, rather than paying undergraduates to create images of these superintendents day book we hired two students: Abby Corcoran, a history major and Lindsay Silver, an English major with a CS minor, to get to know the collection and help us learn what we could if we thought of them as data. As Abby spent the summer researching and writing about the early days of the asylum, she was gathering lists of names of patients, of info on them, etc. And Lindsay created a web portal where the data that Abby was gathering, and other views of the collection as data could be explored.

![Patient Data as Charts](/assets/images/qmh-patient-data-viz.jpg)

You can see that Abby and Lindsay took the notes of the Hospital staff, and regularized the way they understood patients at the time, with columns for the length of insanity, their gender, the weekly rate they paid, etc, in keeping with the hospital staff's concern for only taking patients who were, in their words "curable".

![Patient Data as Table](/assets/images/qmh-patient-data-table.jpg)

Again, this way of providing "access" to collections is one I hope to keep investigating, as I think it challenges us and our students to think through what how we can best use computational and non-computational ways of understanding collections.

So thinking of library collections as data can mean changing the ways we negotiate with vendors,  providing access to digitized collections in formats that are useful for computational reuse, using our own metadata as data, and experimenting with the data we create to make new scholarship. I believe it is through this experimentation with our own data that we can create the expertise and infrastructure to continue being great partners to our faculty and research colleagues as they are also experimenting with data-first approaches to their own research, which leads to the next area.

# Libraries should: Support researcher data
Library collections are not remotely the only kind of data that we should be contending with. As so many disciplines engage with data in its various forms, researchers produce their own data, and we need to continue to expand the kinds of support we can provide for that data as well.

Penn is already doing that by providing support for the creation of Data Management Plans, and by storing data in the institutional repository.
The DMPTools option seems very useful, and I wouldn’t recommend our method for a scale like Penn, at all! At Haverford, our grants office tells every faculty member writing a proposal for funding that requires a data management plan to reach out to me, and the ensuing conversations have really helped me. I’ve worked with faculty in chemistry, psychology, political science, linguistics and biology, and it’s really been a great opportunity for me to gain an understanding of their needs. So I think we need to continue developing these kinds of services.

But before leaving behind the notion of researcher data, I want to point to a project that I haven’t really worked on, but that I think is so fantastic.
This is a site for Project Tier, which was developed by my colleague Norm Medeiros in the library and an econ faculty member, Richard Ball, and funded by the Sloan Foundation and others.
They’ve developed a protocol for student projects, beginning across undergrad institutions but they’re expanding into grad schools,  so  that when they write a paper that makes claims of an empirical nature, that they turn in the paper and the data and the transformations and analysis files. Kind of a pipeline approach to reproducable empirical claims.

## Multimodal Scholarship
By multimodal scholarship, I’m describing the whole range of activities that engage with research or presentation methods that cross format platforms. This might mean a book with an accompanying dataset and website. It might mean a network graph showing participants in a poetry group, it might mean a representation of the topics that emerge from computational approaches to english literature. And it might be a website describing and encoding the underrepresented work of women writiers. It might be a huge range of other things too.

# Libraries should: Make sure our repositories can accept and support multimodal scholarship

So, we all know that digital preservation in general is really hard. Saving things in digital forms is extremely difficult. But, we also know that we need to keep working at it

Data + Interface = Digital Scholarship

But Digital sholarship isn’t just data, it’s also interface, processing, it’s sometimes tied to various tools like browsers or javascript libraries.  I have in my notes: make a joke about how hard it is to store and preserve digital scholarship. But I could not come up with one.

Make allowances in our repositories for multimodal scholarship. Digital scholarship is more than data. And so for each expression of multimodal scholarship, we have to think about what can be saved. Should we think about emulation? Can we separate data from interface and store the data?

This is a video that is currently projected in the gallery in the Magill Library at Haverford to go along with an exhibit  designed by Ashley Foster’s freshman writing course. The course takes on the art and social action during of modernist artists during the spanish civil war, and connects them to quaker peace testimonies, posters , all of which were advocating for a positive peace.

What you’re seeing here is just a screen grab of the students word as they created a network of interconnected annotations across the poetry of Muriel Rukyeser, Picasso’s Guernica, Virginia Woolf and Langston Hughes.
Video here.
here's the video..

This was a freshman writing class that really grew out of a lot of collaborations.

Designing this is a constant balance between the technical work and the needs of the scholarship.  The students in the course worked on the site, but so did my team of student workers, and we all spent tons of time working together and refining and designing. Which brings me my next response to the shift towards multimodal sholarship

# Libraries should: Envision the library as a productive space

Entire life cycle from inspiration to preservation. Library as productive space.
In practice this means developing a flexible technical architecture that allows for scholarship to both dreamed up, created, and stored. And it means developing colleagues in the library whose disciplinary expertise extends across text, image, webpage, dataset, etc.

Transforming technical infrastructure takes time and care. That’s also true of transforming a library. But here I’m talking about

Experimenting, taking some risks, and asking our faculty and students to grow with us was, I think, the only responsible way for us to grow our capacity.


When we started, there were a few projects that the library had committed to, and our friends in IT were understandably hesitant to let us have access to campus servers, as we didn’t really know how to use them or keep them safe. So, we started on Amazon cloud, and did what we could.  At this point, we have a great collaboration with them and 7 virtual machines that they help us maintain.

Professional development aspect of it.  I point to the work that’s been done at UNC and Columbia where librarians took two different approaches to learning tools for multimedial scholarship.

At Haverford, we spend also did a summer workshop series for librarians. We actually spent more time in ours talking about approaches that worked and didn’t work with incoporating tools into courses, but that’s just the nature of Haverford. However it’s done, providing ways for librarians with subject experience to explore the multimodal approaches to scholarship that are emerging in their field is also a really important aspect of expanding our infrastructure.

## Interdisciplinary and community engaged scholarship
All of these topics are huge, and this is the tip of the iceberg.

This is really closely connected to data and to the possibility for multimodal scholarship. This multiplicity of forms of representations. There are shareable ways. There are also
Disciplines are borrowing approaches and objects of study from one another. So . The humanities have important work to do in offering approaches to computational studies im thinking about how algorothms have meankjg. And of course methods from computational studies in the humanities
I think this is happening for a few reasons

We do this work to create knowledge for the world. And we have all of these tools that make that possible. It just feels right to share things earlier and more widely to a lot of people.  This kind of sharing leads to more borrowing and a more open process.

Borrowing methods across disciplines, sharing objects of study across disciplines and engaging with communities we study and serve are parts of my work I’m really interested in. In part because I think that deep inderdisciplinary and multimodal scholarship can challenge us to understanding that the expertise to make sense of a problem might not live in a single mind, but be arrived at together in a group.

# Libraries should: Create and collect repurposable scholarship, when possible

A lot of the work of thinking of materials as data can help with this.  Part of what librarians can do is make methods and processes interdisciplinary.

Libraries should: Make library expertise and resources interdisciplinary and community engaged
Thinking about our own methods, archival methods, digital preservation methods, metadata creation as interdicsiplinary. As available for the pot of scholarly creation. Of course, we should be careful to make sure that the projects we work on expand our infrastructure, our skill sets, help us make more projects sustainable. But, if everyone is getting in on the party of using our skillsets on other peoples objects of studies, let’s join the party.

At Haverford, we created a digital scholarship fellowship program to introduce students to the methods of digital scholarship. For our pilot year, we decided to test out these skills on a public art and research project co-curated by a Haverford faculty member, Paul Farber, a curatorial assistant at RISD, and Ken Lum, of the Fine Arts department here at Penn.. Lead into Monument Lab as an example of making our
As the students in our digital scholarship fellows program went through the year, with every skill or approach they learned, they use monument lab as the project. Here are the students beginning their exercise to think through interface design for the monument lab site.
These are some of our other students. There’s Alliyah. She’s very awesome. In the center courtyard of city hall. Monument lab was a public art and civic engagement project.
The question.
Asking students to think about monuments. About history. About things in space as they learned about digital scholarship.

# Libraries should: Create communities of practice around methods
You’re already doing this here, in great ways.
We’re doing it too. This is actually a picture of all of our summer DS students having some structured pairing and sharing about their projects. I would show them in their work-space, but it’s sadly less attractive than this.
And we’re doing it in the library as well. This is the very beginning of a web site that we’re working on as part of a bit of alinked data study group that we’ve got going. It’s called server summer school, because it started 2 summers ago when we wanted to get better at server stuff. Maven. Docker. Oh my. And we’ve kept it going to keep setting aside time to learn stuff togeter.

One example of data-rich, multimodal, interdisciplinary community engaged scholarship
I’m going to spend a few moments talking about a project I’ve been working on, together with lots of students.

The team includes a linguist at Haverford, one at University of Florida, an ethnohistorian at UNAM in Mexico City.  It involves thinking of our materials as data, it involves interdisciplinary and community engaged scholarship, and it is multimodal.

I want to illustrate what I think is do-able with this cool project.

ticha slides


We’re nearly done. I’ve gone through three changes, and talked about how I think libraries should engage with these changes. But before I stop talking and ask to hear from you, I want to point to a bunch of changes that are affecting academic institutions and scholarship that I haven’t talked about. First, I haven’t really spoken directly to open access, and I’d love to.



Stresses on the publishing industry

Pressures on higher education

Social justice

Environmental emergency

And then there are broader issues. There’s a huge refugee crises going on right now.

I don’t mean to end that on a downer at all, though!

So my prescription fo all of the changes in the first part and these bigger ones. is

# Be the library
The world has always been changing and there have always been huge, massive problems with it. And libraries have been around and changing with technologies for thousands of years. We get to work in an institution, libraries, that is devoted to being an environment where learning comes first. Where people come to change course in their thinking, to develop new methods, to find things out. So, I know I’m kind of ending with a little much.
But, thinking about the changes to academic scholarship that directly affect us, I t

Iterative

Collaborative

Focus on building human capacity while building technical capacity

Focus on our values, of learning, of enabling learning, of creating great scholarship


Be great collaborators. This is our role. We grow together with scholarship.

I just spent a half hour talking about things that libraries should do. ButI bring some ideas about process. But the answers are in this room. They’re not all in my head. Libraries already know how to do really great things. It has to start with the expertise and the values we bring already.

I think the most important thing is not what things we should do but what approach we should take to our work and our communities.
