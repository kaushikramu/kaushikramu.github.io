On February 15, 2016 I started my new job as Assistant Director for Digital Scholarship at the Penn Libraries. I&#8217;m thrilled for this opportunity to be part of a vibrant and exciting community there. In that role, I

Before joining the Penn Libraries, I worked at the Haverford College Libraries, as Coordinator for Digital Scholarship Services.

I became a librarian very shortly after I finished college in 1999 (right around when Google started). Since 2002 when I moved home to Philly, I've worked at Penn or Haverford in departments of reference, research and instruction, and, more recently, digital scholarship. Over the last few years, my career has intersected and been heavily influenced by some of the work that is called Digital Humanities. I have also taken on greater leadership roles. For both of those reasons, it makes sense for me to have a website. That said, part of the reason that I love being a librarian is because I get to learn and be creative and thoughtful without having to write. So, this site is very much an experiment for me. Thanks for visiting.


### About the header image
The image at the top of these pages is from the Philadelphia City Planning Commission Northwest District Plan of 1966. The full plan (and map) are available on the [Philadelphia Neighborhoods Plans](http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/pages%20/index.cfm?so_id=5923) website. Re-doing that site is something that I've wanted to do since it was created in the mid-2000s. I find the plans there incredibly fascinating and scary and sad and strange. The interface, however, does not do them justice in 2016. So, we're working on a new one now that I'm back at the Penn Libraries.
