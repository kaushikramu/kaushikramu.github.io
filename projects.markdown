As Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Services at the [Haverford
College Libraries](library.haverford.edu.html), I’ve participated in a
variety of projects. The work of our whole team is visible at the
[Digital Scholarship Website](ds.haverford.edu.html). Here, I’m
featuring a few projects only. All of these projects are collaborative
projects, and Ive tried to be clear about the part I played in them.
But, please assume that Mike Zarafonetis and the awesome team of Digital
Scholarship student assistants has been vital to each of the projects.

The projects I’ve been involved in take a number of shapes. For some
projects, I’ve been deeply involved, together with my colleagues in the
library, from the beginning. Those include:

Ticha: A digital text explorer for Colonial Zapotec. This projects is
directed by Professor Brook Lillehaugen of the Linguistics Department,
and Collaborators Michel Oukijk and Aaron Broadwell.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked with colleagues in DS and in
Special Collections to support and manage student internships designed
to make new and creative uses of materials from the Quaker and Special
Collections in the Libraries.

The Cope Evans Project. This project was developed by two freshman and
one junior (Andrew Kafker, Cormac Rada and Brandon Smith) as an
internship in the summer of 2014. It grew with the help of a short term
graduate assistant (Stephanie Lampkin) in the winter of 2015, and
significant new material will be added to the site in the fall of 2015
based on the work of three students in the summer of 2015.

After Penn’s Treaty: Quakers and American Indians. Site coming soon.

There are also projects where I have mostly consulted and/or provide
technical or project management support, together with my colleagues in
the Digital Scholarship group in the library. These include

Global Terrorism Research Project
([gtrp.haverford.edu](http://gtrp.haverford.edu))

While my work on [Monument Lab](http://www.monumentlab.com) started as
part of our work with the Digital Scholarship Fellows, it grew from
there, and has become a project I remain engaged in both at work and out
of work.  I served as the Director of Research at Monument Lab and was
responsible for the creation of the map, and for working with colleagues
on gathering the proposals and understanding them through formal
research means.
