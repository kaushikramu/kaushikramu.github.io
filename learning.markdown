Other non-formal expertise
--------------------------

I do not think of myself as a coder or a developer. I can use HTML and
CSS.  I can generally, eventually make things work in javascript, and I
know a little python and php. I have worked a bit under the hood with
jekyll, drupal, wordpress, django, and flask, in addition to lots of
time in Omeka. I have experience working in apache and nginx, and with
mysql and postgresql. I’ve set up a geoserver, but I woudn’t want to do
it again. I know some GIS using both QGIS and ESRI ArcGIS. I’ve worked a
little bit with SPSS and NVivo for quantitative and qualitative data
analysis. Also, I know a lot about the U.S. Census and data sources for
the city of Philadelphia.
